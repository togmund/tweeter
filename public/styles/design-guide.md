<!--
Create the HTML markup and CSS styling for your tweet element based on the reference image below

Follow these rules/tips when creating the markup. Read these all before starting:

  - We can consider a tweet to be an article, and there's an HTML5 tag for that!
  - You shouldn't be using an IDs within this component (do you know why?).
  - Consider that the tweet article has a header and a footer. There are HTML5 - tags for those too! This way you're not just using plain ol' <div> tags that have no semantic meaning.
  - Just put in fake/dummy text where needed so that you have some content to visualize.
  - Write out the HTML for the component without adding any CSS classes and then as you style it out, decide which CSS classes you really need and where you can simply use tag based selectors
  - For example: article.tweet header is a more clear and specific enough selector compared to article.tweet header.tweet-header. This is because we expect to find only one header per tweet and therefore the class tweet-header is repetitive. Avoiding overuse of CSS classes like this is an important practice. If you're unclear on this, speak to a peer or mentor.
  - Here is an image to use as a reference. Aim to make your tweet look like the one in the image.
